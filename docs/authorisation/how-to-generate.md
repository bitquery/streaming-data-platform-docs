# How to Generate a Token

In this section, we will see how OAuth is used to generate a token. 

The first step is to create an application:


1.  **Create an Application**: Navigate to the [Applications](https://account.bitquery.io/user/api_v2/applications) page and click `Create application`. Enter a name for your application and select an expiration time for the access tokens. Click `Create`.

2.  **Generate Access Token**: We provide two methods to generate a token:

- You can generate a token for your application with a set expiration time.
- Or you can use your client ID-secret from your application to make a POST request to https://oauth2.bitquery.io/oauth2/token and get a token programmatically.


> **If you have no applications created, the `Bearer` token changes every 12 hours. If the token is invalid, you get "Unauthorized"  message.**

## Generating a Token with Set Expiration Time

1.  Go to the [Access Token](https://account.bitquery.io/user/api_v2/access_tokens) page and select the application for which you want to generate an access token.

2.  Click **Generate Access Token**.
3.  Copy the access token and store it in a secure location.

**Using the token:**

To utilize the token you've copied from the API-KEY tab, use the code generation feature on your IDE to obtain the code in your preferred programming language. However, **remember to paste the token you've copied from the API-Key page**. This is necessary because the IDE code generator only displays temporary tokens.

For example, you can include the token in the header as shown below:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>

```

Refer Postman examples [here](https://www.postman.com/spacecraft-geologist-86385692/workspace/bitquery/collection/27392958-a162bd5f-3574-4033-8ea7-8e9947e08b54?action=share&creator=27392958)

**Revoking an Access Token**

If you believe that your access token has been compromised, you can revoke it by clicking **Revoke** on the **Applications** page.

## Generating a Token Programmatically

Remember that this approach requires more effort to implement. It is suitable for applications with a high risk of token theft or misuse. This approach expects you to programmatically generate an access token using your client ID and client secret of an application.

Below is a code snippet in Python that shows you how to programmatically generate a token and use the API, replace the placeholders with actual information.

Ensure that `scope=api` is mentioned in the payload,

```
import requests
import json


def oAuth_example():

  url = "https://oauth2.bitquery.io/oauth2/token"

  payload = 'grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=YOUR_ID_HERE&client_secret=YOUR_SECRET_HERE&scope=api'

  headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}

  response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload)
  resp = json.loads(response.text)
  print(resp)
  access_token=resp['access_token']

  url_graphql = "https://streaming.bitquery.io/graphql"
  headers_graphql = {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}'
  }

  //use the token to send a request


oAuth_example()
```

The response will include details on `scope` and `expiration time` of the token. A sample response looks like this:

```
{'access_token': 'ory_at_sKK8sSq8', 'expires_in': 2627999, 'scope': 'api', 'token_type': 'bearer'}

```

**Deleting an Application**

If you no longer need an application, you can delete it by clicking **Delete** on the **Applications** page. All the tokens associated with the application will no longer work.

**Billing Considerations**

- Billing remains consistent across API v1 and v2.
- Purchase points once and utilize them for either v1 or v2 in any combination.
