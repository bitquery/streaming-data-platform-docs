# Get Supply and Marketcap of a Token

## Get Supply of a Token

Let's see how to get the supply of a Token. We are taking TONCOIN token example in the following query. The token address for TONCOIN token is [0x582d872A1B094FC48F5DE31D3B73F2D9bE47def1](https://etherscan.io/token/0x582d872a1b094fc48f5de31d3b73f2d9be47def1)
You can check out the query [here](https://ide.bitquery.io/Total-supply-of-a-token-on-ethereum-mainnet_1).

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  EVM(network: eth, dataset: combined) {
    Transfers(
      where: {
        Transfer: {
          Currency: {
            SmartContract: { is: "0x582d872A1B094FC48F5DE31D3B73F2D9bE47def1" }
          }
          Success: true
        }
      }
    ) {
      minted: sum(
        of: Transfer_Amount
        if: {
          Transfer: {
            Sender: { is: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000" }
          }
        }
      )
      burned: sum(
        of: Transfer_Amount
        if: {
          Transfer: {
            Receiver: { is: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000" }
          }
        }
      )
    }
  }
}
```

## Get Marketcap of a token

Below query can be used to calculate Marketcap of a Token, first the query gets supply in the `amount` field then query uses join to get the `PriceInUSD`. Multiplying both of these will give you marketcap of the token.
In this example, we are calculating marketcap of Pepes Dog (ZEUS) token which has smart contract address `0x0f7dC5D02CC1E1f5Ee47854d534D332A1081cCC8`.
Try the query [here](https://ide.bitquery.io/supply-and-latest-price-of-token-to-get-marketcap).

```
{
  EVM(dataset: combined) {
    Transfers(
      limit: {count: 1}
      where: {Call: {Create: true}, Transfer: {Currency: {SmartContract: {is: "0x0f7dc5d02cc1e1f5ee47854d534d332a1081ccc8"}}, Sender: {is: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"}}}
    ) {
      Transfer {
        Amount
        Sender
        Receiver
      }
      joinDEXTradeByTokens(
        limit: {count: 1}
        join: inner
        Trade_Currency_SmartContract: Transfer_Currency_SmartContract
      ) {
        Trade {
          Price(maximum: Block_Time)
          PriceInUSD
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
