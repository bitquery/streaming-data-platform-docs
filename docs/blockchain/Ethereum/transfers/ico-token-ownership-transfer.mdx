# Analysing Token ICO with Transfers APIs

In this segment we will learn how you can analyse a project's ICO performance, to help investors in taking smart investment decisions based on that knowledge. For this tutorial, we will look up the info related to [PEPU](https://explorer.bitquery.io/ethereum/token/0x906cc2ad139eb6637e28605f908903c8adce566a) token

## Decoding the ICO Process

In most of the ICOs, the token is minted to a smart contract that contains various methods for distributing the token whenever the conditions set by project owners are satisfied.

[Here](https://ide.bitquery.io/Get-Minted-Address-of-the-ICO-Token) is the query to find if the token in question also follows a similiar procedure, and if yes, then contract address of the distributer. 

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  EVM(network: eth, dataset: combined) {
    Transfers(
      where: {Transfer: {Currency: {SmartContract: {is: "0x906cc2ad139eb6637e28605f908903c8adce566a"}}, Success: true, Sender: {is: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"}}}
    ) {
      Transfer {
        Amount
        Currency {
          Name
          Symbol
          SmartContract
        }
        Receiver
        Sender
      }
    }
  }
}

```
The ContractAddress field in Receipt section returns the distributer contract address.

## More Info on Investors

### List of Investor Addresses

Use this [query](https://ide.bitquery.io/Get-all-Holders-Address-of-the-ICO-Token_1) for getting the list of the potential investors who invested in the project via ICO.

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  EVM(network: eth, dataset: combined) {
    Transfers(
      where: {Transfer: {Currency: {SmartContract: {is: "0x906cc2ad139eb6637e28605f908903c8adce566a"}}, Success: true, Sender: {is: "0xf0163c18f8d3fc8d5b4ca15e07d0f9f75460335f"}}}
    ) {
      Transfer {
        Amount
        Currency {
          Name
          Symbol
          SmartContract
        }
        Receiver
        Sender
      }
      count
    }
  }
}

```

### Number of Unique Investors in ICO 

[This](https://ide.bitquery.io/Number-of-Purchasers-in-ICO#) query retrieves the number of unique investors who might have participated in the  ongoing ICO event for the PEPU token.

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  EVM(network: eth, dataset: combined) {
    Transfers(
      where: {Transfer: {Amount: {gt: "0"}, Currency: {SmartContract: {is: "0x906cc2ad139eb6637e28605f908903c8adce566a"}}, Sender: {is: "0xf0163c18f8d3fc8d5b4ca15e07d0f9f75460335f"}}}
    ) {
      count
      Transfer {
        Currency {
          Name
          Symbol
          SmartContract
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
