# Ethereum API - Complete Developer Guide

## What is Bitquery?

Bitquery is the leading blockchain data platform that provides comprehensive **Ethereum API** solutions for developers. Instead of running your own Ethereum node or building complex indexing infrastructure, you can use our pre-built **Ethereum API** to get the blockchain data you need in seconds.

Our **Ethereum API** provides comprehensive access to all Ethereum blockchain data including transactions, token balances, DEX trades, liquidity events, blocks, smart contract events, gas fees, mempool data, and NFT information. Available through GraphQL API with real-time streaming via GraphQL subscriptions and Kafka.

## Getting Started

New to Bitquery? Here's how to get started:

1. **[Create a free account](https://ide.bitquery.io/)** - Get instant access to our GraphQL IDE
2. **[Generate your API key](https://docs.bitquery.io/docs/authorisation/how-to-generate/)** - Required for API access
3. **[Run your first query](https://docs.bitquery.io/docs/start/first-query/)** - Learn the basics in 5 minutes
4. **[Explore examples](https://docs.bitquery.io/docs/start/starter-queries/)** - Copy-paste ready queries

**Free Trial**: 100,000 API points for 1 month. No credit card required.

## Why Choose Bitquery's Ethereum API?

Unlike traditional Ethereum JSON-RPC providers, our **Ethereum API** stores, indexes, and enriches every Ethereum transaction, event, contract call, token transfer, balance update, and DEX trade. Our advanced **Ethereum API** allows you to query both historical and real-time Ethereum blockchain data from multiple dimensions without the complexity of running your own infrastructure.

### Key Benefits of Our Ethereum API:
- **Complete Data Coverage**: Access to all Ethereum blockchain data since genesis
- **Real-time Updates**: Live data streaming via GraphQL subscriptions and Kafka
- **Advanced Analytics**: Pre-computed metrics and enriched data
- **Developer-Friendly**: GraphQL interface with comprehensive documentation
- **High Performance**: Sub-second response times for complex queries
- **Cost-Effective**: Free tier with 1,000 API calls per day


## How is it different from raw Ethereum RPC or Ethereum node API?

**Ethereum RPC**

- Low‑level JSON‑RPC that returns raw node data
- No historical indexing, joins, or analytics out of the box
- Best for transaction submission and node-level introspection

**Bitquery Ethereum API**

- Pre‑indexed, enriched datasets exposed via GraphQL
- Powerful filtering, joins, aggregations, and subscriptions (Websockets / Webhooks)
- Ideal for building applications, analytics, monitoring, dashboards, and reporting without running infra

## What can you build with it?

Build powerful applications including:
- **Trading Tools**: Trading terminals, bots, and automated strategies
- **Portfolio Trackers**: Monitor wallet portfolios and token holders
- **Compliance Tools**: Tax reporting, auditing, and accounting products
- **DeFi Analytics**: Monitor DEX price/volume and liquidity events
- **Network Analysis**: Analyze gas usage, fees, and network health
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Stream mempool activity and pending transactions
- **Business Intelligence**: Compute KPIs over blocks/transactions for dashboards

## Real-time Data & Streaming

Get live Ethereum data through our streaming solutions:

- **GraphQL Subscriptions**: Convert any query to a live stream by changing `query` to `subscription`
- **Kafka Streaming**: High-throughput streaming for enterprise applications

See examples and code snippets [here](https://docs.bitquery.io/docs/subscriptions/websockets/) for GraphQL subscription implementation, and learn about [Kafka streaming](https://docs.bitquery.io/docs/streams/kafka-streaming-concepts/) for high-volume use cases.
