# Mempool API

In this section we will look at some examples of how to write mempool queries to extract the necessary data from broadcasted transactions. To read more about how we offer mempool data, read the introduction [here](/docs/subscriptions/mempool-subscriptions.md)

## Simulating Pending Transactions

The below query retrieves information about in-flight transactions, helping you simulate the most recent state. It is a way to see if they will succeed without sending them on-chain. The `Success` field tells you if your mempool tranaction is successful and `FaultError` and `FaultError` indicate otherwise.
You can find query [here](https://ide.bitquery.io/Simulating-Pending-Transactions_1)

```
subscription{
  EVM(mempool: true) {
    Transfers{
      Log {
        Index
      }
      Transaction {
        Time
        Type
        To
        Gas
        From
        Cost
        Hash
      }
      Transfer {
        Amount
        Currency {
          Name
        }
        Type
      }
      TransactionStatus {
        Success
        FaultError
        FaultError
      }
      Block {
        Time
      }
    }
  }
}


```

## Get Recommended Fees

The Recommended Fees API provides real-time data from the mempool. It returns fields such as block time, block number, transaction hash, transaction cost, sender address, recipient address, base fee, burnt fees, sender fees, priority fees per gas, miner rewards, gas refunds, effective gas prices, and potential savings. You can use it to build applications that require up-to-date information about recommended transaction fees.

You can run the query [here](https://ide.bitquery.io/Get-Mempool-Fees)

```
{
  EVM(mempool: true) {
    Transactions(limit: {count: 100}) {
      Block {
        Time
        Number
        BaseFee
      }
      Transaction {
        Hash
        Cost
        To
        From
      }
      Fee {
        Burnt
        SenderFee
        PriorityFeePerGas
        MinerReward
        GasRefund
        EffectiveGasPrice
        Savings
      }
    }
  }
}


```

## PairCreated Events

This query returns information about transactions that have triggered the `PairCreated` event in the mempool, including the transaction hash, log signature, and argument values. You can run the query [here](https://ide.bitquery.io/PairCreated-in-Mempool)

```

  EVM(mempool: true) {
    Events(where: {Log: {Signature: {Name: {is: "PairCreated"}}}}) {
      Transaction {
        Hash
      }
      Log{
        Signature{
          Name
        }
      }
      Arguments {
        Name
        Value {
          ... on EVM_ABI_Integer_Value_Arg {
            integer
          }
          ... on EVM_ABI_String_Value_Arg {
            string
          }
          ... on EVM_ABI_Address_Value_Arg {
            address
          }
          ... on EVM_ABI_BigInt_Value_Arg {
            bigInteger
          }
          ... on EVM_ABI_Bytes_Value_Arg {
            hex
          }
          ... on EVM_ABI_Boolean_Value_Arg {
            bool
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```
