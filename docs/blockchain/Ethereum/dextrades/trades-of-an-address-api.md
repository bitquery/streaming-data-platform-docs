## Trades Where the Address is Buyer OR Seller

The below query gives you trades where the specified address is either as a buyer or a seller. This is achieved by utilizing the `any` filter, which acts as an OR condition to encompass both buyer and seller roles in the results.
You can find the query [here](https://ide.bitquery.io/Address-is-Buyer-or-Seller-V2)

```
query MyQuery {
  EVM(dataset: archive, network: eth) {
    DEXTrades(
      where: {any: [{Trade: {Buy: {Buyer: {is: "0xacefce78e31332cf2d1b9e770d609c31d26afc09"}}}},
      {Trade: {Buy: {Seller: {is: "0xacefce78e31332cf2d1b9e770d609c31d26afc09"}}}}]}
      limit: {count: 10}
      orderBy: {descending: Block_Time}
    ) {
      Trade {
        Buy {
          Buyer
          Amount
          Currency {
            Name
