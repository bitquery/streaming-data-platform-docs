# NFT Calls API
This API helps retrieve information about smart contract transactions, including details about the contract function that was called, the input and output parameters, and more. 

## Latest Calls for an NFT

Here's an example query that retrieve the most recent smart contract calls made on an NFT token contract. 

```graphql 
{
  EVM {
    Calls(
      limit: {count: 10}
      orderBy: {descending: Block_Time}
      where: {Call: {To: {is: "0x60e4d786628fea6478f785a6d7e704777c86a7c6"}}}
    ) {
      Call {
        From
        Gas
        GasUsed
        To
        Value
      }
      Transaction {
        Hash
      }
      Arguments {
        Name
        Value {
          ... on EVM_ABI_Integer_Value_Arg {
            integer
          }
          ... on EVM_ABI_String_Value_Arg {
            string

          ... on EVM_ABI_Address_Value_Arg {
            address
