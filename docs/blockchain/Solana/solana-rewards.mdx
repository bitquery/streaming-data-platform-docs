## Latest Rewards

The query below helps track the most recent reward distributions on the Solana blockchain in real-time.
You can find the query [here](https://ide.bitquery.io/Latest-Solana-Rewards)

```
subscription {
  Solana {
    Rewards(limit: {count: 10}) {
      Block {
        Hash
        Height
        Slot
        RewardsCount
        Time
      }
      Reward {
        RewardType
        PostBalance
        Index
        Commission
        Amount
        Address
      }
    }
  }
}

```

## Rewards for a Wallet Address

If you're interested in tracking the rewards for a specific wallet address, you can modify the query to filter results based on the address. This allows stakeholders to monitor their own rewards or analyze rewards distribution to specific addresses over time. You can find the query [here](https://ide.bitquery.io/Rewards-for-a-wallet-address)

```
subscription {
  Solana {
    Rewards(
      limit: {count: 10}
      where: {Reward: {Address: {is: "HnfPZDrbJFooiP9vvgWrjx3baXVNAZCgisT58gyMCgML"}}}
    ) {
      Block {
        Hash
        Height
        Slot
        RewardsCount
        Time
      }
      Reward {
        RewardType
        PostBalance
        Index
        Commission
        Amount
        Address
      }
    }
  }
}

```
