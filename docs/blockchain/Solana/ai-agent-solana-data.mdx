# Build AI Trading Agents with Bitquery Solana Data

In this section, we will explore how to use **Bitquery APIs and real-time streams** to build AI-enabled trading agents for the **Solana blockchain**.

**You can also build [MCPs using Bitquery](https://youtu.be/q-QL5EGfT5k)**

**Your AI Trading Agent's Mission:**


>You are a specialized trading agent operating on the Solana blockchain, you will optimize an existing portfolio by analyzing and trading trending tokens using Bitquery data. Your primary goal is to identify profitable tokens in the market, assess wallet balances, and execute calculated swap decisions to enhance portfolio value.

```
prompt = (
        f"Analyze the following Solana token:\n"
        f"Name: {token_data['name']}\n"
        f"Symbol: {token_data['symbol']}\n"
        f"Market Cap: {token_data['market_cap']}\n"
        f"Liquidity (USD): {token_data['liquidity_usd']}\n"
        f"Volatility: {token_data['volatility']}\n"
        f"Top Holder Concentration (%): {token_data['holder_concentration']}\n"
        "\nBased on this data, decide whether to 'Buy', 'Avoid', or 'Hold'. Only reply with one word: Buy, Avoid, or Hold."
    )
```

### Trading Decision Process

This is a rough draft of what an AI agent can do using on-chain and off-chain data:

1. Use trending data to identify promising tokens with potential profit.
2. For each trending token, retrieve detailed information to evaluate its market cap, liquidity, volatility, and security.
3. Check the wallet balance to understand the available assets and decide on a safe percentage to invest.
4. Execute swaps to acquire trending tokens, ensuring the chosen amount.
5. Continuously monitor token performance and adjust holdings to maximize profits. For this you can use [Bitquery Shred Streams](https://docs.bitquery.io/docs/streams/real-time-solana-data/#kafka-stream-by-bitquery) to monitor token prices, new token creation and other activities with sub-second latency.

## Code Structure and Logic: A Good Starting Point

Your code sets up a flexible AI trading agent framework, handling:

- backtesting : historical simulation.
- live mode: real-time trading/decision making
- Portfolio tracking (cash, positions, realized gains)
- Integration with an AI model (likely LLM) to guide trading decisions
- where the AI agent makes data-driven trading decisions based on Bitquery Solana data.

Below is a sample project structure:

```
ai_trading_agent/
├── main.py               # Entry point for agent
├── bitquery_utils.py     # Bitquery API functions
├── ai_decision.py        # AI model logic for trade decisions
├── wallet_utils.py       # Wallet balance + transaction logic
├── config.env            # Store API keys securely

```

      }
      Transaction {
        Signature
        Index
        Result {
          Success
        }
      }
      Trade {
        Index
        Dex {
          ProgramAddress

          Price
          PriceInUSD
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

**Use:** React instantly to time-sensitive trades.

### 6. Token Holders Distribution (Security Check)

Check token decentralization to avoid risky, whale-dominated assets.

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand GraphQL query</summary>

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  Solana {
    BalanceUpdates(
      orderBy: { descendingByField: "BalanceUpdate_Holding_maximum" }
      where: {
        BalanceUpdate: {
          Currency: {
            MintAddress: { is: "EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v" }
          }
        }
        Transaction: { Result: { Success: true } }
      }
    ) {
      BalanceUpdate {
        Currency {
          Name
          MintAddress
          Symbol
        }
        Account {
          Address
        }
        Holding: PostBalance(maximum: Block_Slot, selectWhere: { gt: "0" })
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

**Use:** Avoid tokens with highly concentrated ownership that may be vulnerable to manipulation.

### 7. Avoiding Bots with DEXRabbit (Built by Bitquery)

Your AI Trading Agent should monitor **bot activity** on DEXs. Bots can cause **sudden price spikes**, **wash trading**, or manipulate token prices, posing risks to human traders.

**[DexRabbit.com](https://dexrabbit.com/)**, built on Bitquery data, offers charts and dashboards to detect bot activity in real-time.

### Key Bot Activity Indicators to Monitor:

![DexRabbit Bot Detection using Charts](/img/usecases/gopher_bot.png)

| Indicator                              | Description                                                           |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Highly repetitive trade patterns**   | Identical trades happening in short intervals suggest bot activity.   |
| **Large trade bursts at odd hours**    | Bots often execute trades at low-liquidity times to influence price.  |
| **Frequent pump-and-dump patterns**    | Sharp price surges followed by rapid sell-offs indicate manipulation. |
| **Unusual token holder concentration** | Bots may use multiple wallets to appear as unique traders.            |

## Calculating Trading Indicators

You can SMA, EMA, RSI etc with Bitquery data. A tutorial is available [here](https://docs.bitquery.io/docs/usecases/trading-indicators/)

Your AI Agent can reconstruct price charts and calculate:

- SMA 50: Simple Moving Average over last 50 data points (could be trades, time intervals, etc.).

- SMA 200: Simple Moving Average over last 200 data points.

Detect crossovers:

- SMA 50 crosses above SMA 200 → Consider Buy.

- SMA 50 crosses below SMA 200 → Consider Sell.

This logic can be integrated into the AI Trading Loop along with the on-chain analysis.

## Building the AI Trading Loop

Your AI Trading Agent combines the above streams as follows:

1. Fetch Top Trending Tokens to shortlist candidates.
2. For each token:

   - Analyze Liquidity, Volatility, and Holders Distribution.

3. Check Wallet Balances to calculate possible investment amount.
4. Use Real-Time Trade Streams to time the market entry.
5. Execute Swaps on high-potential tokens.
6. Continuously monitor market data and adjust holdings as needed.


## Next Steps

- Integrate these Bitquery APIs into your AI agent.
- Define risk management parameters, such as maximum percentage of balance per trade.
- Automate decision-making logic based on market data.
- Continuously refine and improve trading strategies using real-time data.

You can also integrate off-chain information like Twitter feeds to decide if a token is worth investing

- Combine with **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** to do **sentiment analysis** on tweets.
- Build **alert systems** based on specific keywords or sentiment spikes.
- Monitor tweets from key influencers and trigger trades based on their content.
- Use Twitter data as a factor in your **AI models' decision-making**.
