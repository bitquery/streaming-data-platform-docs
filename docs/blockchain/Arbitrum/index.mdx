## What is the Bitquery Arbitrum API?

It's a GraphQL interface over curated, indexed Arbitrum data. Write powerful queries instead of building and maintaining your own indexer for the fastest L2 solution.

## What can you build with it?

Track GMX perpetual positions, monitor DEX liquidity and trading volumes, analyze cross-chain bridge flows, stream smart contract events, compute trading KPIs, and power real-time dashboards for the most active L2 ecosystem.

## How is it different from raw Arbitrum RPC?

| Feature             | Arbitrum RPC                     | Bitquery Arbitrum API          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Data Format**     | Raw JSON-RPC responses           | Pre-indexed, enriched GraphQL  |
| **Historical Data** | No built-in history              | Full historical data since L2  |
| **Analytics**       | Manual aggregation required      | Built-in joins, aggregations   |
| **Real-time**       | Basic subscription support       | Rich streaming with filtering  |
| **Use Case**        | Transaction submission, node ops | Analytics, monitoring, trading |
| **Infrastructure**  | Run your own nodes               | Fully managed, auto-scaling    |

Most queries can be turned into live streams by switching `query` to `subscription`, and consumed over WebSocket. See examples and code snippets [here](https://docs.bitquery.io/docs/subscriptions/websockets/).
