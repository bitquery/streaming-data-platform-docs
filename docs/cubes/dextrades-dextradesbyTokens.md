# DEXTrades vs DEXTradesByTokens

This guide helps you choose the right cube for your use case and provides advanced processing patterns based on production implementations.

### DEXTrades Cube

The **DEXTrades Cube** provides detailed information about decentralized exchange (DEX) trading data, focusing on the perspective of the pool involved in the trade. Here's a breakdown of its features:

- **Trade Perspective**: The data is presented from the pool's perspective. In every trade, one of the participants must be a pool, and the cube shows the pool's buy and sell details.
- **Buyer and Seller Identification**: The cube clearly differentiates the buyer and seller based on the pool's perspective. The poolâ€™s buy details include the currency bought by the pool, while the sell details include the currency sold by the pool.
- **Filtering**: Allows filtering of trades based on various criteria such as buy currency, sell currency, buyer, seller, DEX, pool, sender, receiver, transaction, time, etc.
- **Aggregation**: Supports aggregation of data based on time, amount, address, currency, type, buyer, seller, DEX, pool address, block time, etc.
- **Metrics**: Offers metrics for sum, count, average, median, maximum, minimum, etc., enabling comprehensive trade analysis.

Example API call from DEXTrades Cube:

```graphql
{
  EVM(dataset: archive, network: eth) {
    DEXTrades(
      limit: { count: 2 }
      where: {
        Transaction: {
          Hash: {
            is: "0x672b64a68f612667111fb2e1329dc1b47279042e1b84d894aa64119ae34a989f"
          }
        }
      }
    ) {
      Transaction {
        Hash
      }
      Trade {
        Buy {
          AmountInUSD
          Buyer
          Currency {
            Name
          }
          Seller
          Currency {
            Name
          }
          AmountInUSD
        }
        Sell {
          AmountInUSD
          Buyer
          Currency {
            Name
          }
          Seller
          Currency {
            Name
          }
          AmountInUSD
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### DEXTradesByTokens Cube

The **DEXTradesByTokens Cube** provides a more granular view of the DEX trading data, including details from both sides of the trade for each participant. Here's a breakdown of its features:

- **Trade Perspective**: The data includes both participants' perspectives in a trade. Each user is shown as both a buyer and a seller.
- **Buyer and Seller Identification**: The cube displays each user involved in the trade as both a buyer and a seller, reflecting the trade from both perspectives.
- **Filtering**: Allows filtering of trades based on currency, buyer, seller, DEX, pool, sender, transaction, time, etc.
- **Aggregation**: Supports aggregation of data based on trade currency, amount, seller, buyer, address, DEX, pool address, block time, etc.
- **Metrics**: Offers metrics similar to the DEXTrades cube for sum, count, average, median, maximum, minimum, etc., with a focus on token-specific trade analysis.

Example API call from DEXTradesByTokens Cube:

```graphql
{
  EVM(network: bsc, dataset: combined) {
    DEXTradeByTokens(
      where: {
        Transaction: {
          Hash: {
            is: "0xf23cd0e4d85e0a66d58cf68af929b1fab34d72c3f0df0199d221fa8809e702b1"
          }
        }
      }
    ) {
      ChainId
      Block {
        Number
        Time
      }
      Trade {
        Seller
        Buyer
        Amount
        Currency {
          SmartContract
          Symbol
        }
        Price
        Side {
          Amount
          Currency {
            SmartContract
            Symbol
          }
        }
      }
      Transaction {
        Hash
      }
    }
  }
}
```


## When to Use Each Cube

### Use DEXTrades When:

1. **Volume Tracking Applications**: You need accurate volume calculations from the pool's perspective
2. **Multi-hop Trade Detection**: Processing complex routing scenarios where trades span multiple hops
3. **Proxy Contract Handling**: Dealing with router contracts and need inverted buy/sell logic
4. **Pool-centric Analysis**: Analyzing liquidity pool behavior and MEV detection

**Example Use Case: Volume Alert System**
```python
# DEXTrades is ideal for tracking actual trading volumes
def process_volume_alerts(trade_data):
    # Use pool perspective for accurate volume calculation
    if trade_data['buy_contract'] == '0x':  # Native token buy
        volume = trade_data['sell_amount']  # Payment amount
        token = trade_data['buy_contract']
    elif trade_data['sell_contract'] == '0x':  # Native token sell
        volume = trade_data['buy_amount']   # Payment amount
        token = trade_data['sell_contract']
    
    return process_token_volume(token, volume)
```

### Use DEXTradesByTokens When:

1. **User-centric Analysis**: Tracking individual trader behavior and portfolio changes
2. **Token Flow Analysis**: Understanding how tokens move between addresses
3. **Simpler Processing Logic**: When you don't need complex multi-hop detection
4. **Portfolio Tracking**: Building user portfolio dashboards

**Example Use Case: User Portfolio Tracker**
```python
# DEXTradesByTokens shows both sides of each user's activity
def update_user_portfolio(user_address, trades):
    for trade in trades:
        if trade['seller'] == user_address:
            # User sold this token
            portfolio[trade['currency']]['balance'] -= trade['amount']
        if trade['buyer'] == user_address:
            # User bought this token
            portfolio[trade['currency']]['balance'] += trade['amount']
```


Both cubes support advanced filtering, aggregation, and metric calculations, allowing for detailed and customizable data retrieval and analysis for DEX trades.
