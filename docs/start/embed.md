# Use it in Your Application

You can integrate both queries and subscriptions in your application on any programming language and framework.
First, you create a query or subscription in [IDE](/docs/ide/login), and then you embed this query
and some client code in your application. The client code depends on the programming language
and set of libraries you prefer to use. Try searching Google for "GraphQL YOUR-LANGUAGE library" keyword to start with.


[IDE](/docs/ide/login) provides an example code template for your queries 
on some programming languages. After you create the query, press the ```</>``` button
located to the right of the endpoint URL entry field. 
You will see the code snippet and the selection of languages and libraries to use:

Select your programming language and run the code in your application.

Note that you have to use your [API key](/docs/ide/authorisation.md). [IDE](/docs/ide/login) automatically
substituted it for you in the code, but in the production environment you may need to change it
to another one, potentially with the [paid plan](/docs/ide/paid).
