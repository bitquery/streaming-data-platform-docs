# Endpoints and Regions

Bitquery provides multiple regional endpoints to optimize latency and performance. Choose the endpoint closest to your geographic location for the best experience.

## Overview

Bitquery offers three API versions:

- **V1**: GraphQL API for historical blockchain data
- **V2** & **EAP**: Streaming GraphQL API with real-time and historical data
