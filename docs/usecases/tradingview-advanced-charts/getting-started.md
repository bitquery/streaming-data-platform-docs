# Getting Started

In this tutorial we will see how to use [TradingView's Advanced Charts API](https://in.tradingview.com/advanced-charts/) and plot DEX trading data with Bitquery APIs. You can find the complete code of the tutorial [here](https://github.com/bitquery/advanced-charts-TV-example)

The final chart will look like ![this](/img/ApplicationExamples/advanced-charts.png)

- To do that you need to get access to TradingView's private Advanced Charts API library by filling out the form.
- Next create a new React project.
- Once done, follow the first 2 steps on their [tutorial](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/tutorials/First-Run-Tutorial) to add  **charting_library** and **datafeeds** library to your new React project folder. For this tutorial **I have added the folders in the parent directory**.

- Now we will write different parts of the logic

        - The main App
        - The component to call Bitquery API
        - The widget code
        - The custom datafeed object
        - Building candlestick bars


- Next, go to [Component Page](https://docs.bitquery.io/docs/usecases/tradingview-advanced-charts/component/) to start building.
