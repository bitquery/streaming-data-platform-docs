# Filtering

In most cases you do not need the full dataset, but just a portion, related to the
entity or range you are interested in.

import VideoPlayer from "../../src/components/videoplayer.js";

Filtering can be applied to queries and subscriptions:

- in query, filter defines what part of the dataset you need in results
- with subscription, filter also determine when the updated data will be sent to you. If the new data does not match filter, update will not be triggered

:::tip
Use filters in subscription for notification services on specific type of events matching filter criteria
:::

Filters are defined on the cube element level (Blocks, Transactions, so on) as a `where` attribute.

## Using the OR Condition

In certain cases, you might want to execute a query that filters results based on one condition **OR** another. This type of query can be particularly useful when you need to retrieve records that meet at least one of multiple criteria.
This can be achieved with the `any` operator.

The below query for example, retrieves blocks from the Ethereum archive dataset where the block number is greater than `19111970` **OR** the transaction count within a block is greater than `100`.
You can run the query [here](https://ide.bitquery.io/using-OR-condition-example-V2)

> Note: The `any` filter must always be an array.

```
{
  EVM(dataset: archive, network: eth) {
    Blocks(
      where: {any: [{Block: {Number: {gt: "19111970"}}}, {Block: {TxCount: {gt: 100}}}]}
      limit: {count: 10}
    ) {
      Block {
        Bloom
        Date
        Time
        Root
        TxCount
      }
    }
  }
}

```

## Examples

```graphql
{
  EVM {
    Blocks(where: { Block: { GasUsed: { ge: "14628560" } } }) {
      Block {
        Number
      }
    }
  }
}
```

returns block numbers with gas used exceeding certain level. `where` attribute is structured,
with the same levels as the query schema. This allows to build complex filters by combining criteria,
as in the following example:

```graphql
\{
  EVM \{
    Transactions(
      where: \{
        Block: \{ GasUsed: \{ ge: "26000000" \} \}
        Transaction: \{ Gas: \{ ge: "16000000" \} \}
      }
    ) \{
      Block \{
        GasUsed
      }
      Transaction \{
        Gas
      }
    }
  }
}
```

:::note
filters are combined by **AND** principles, result set is an intersection of all criteria defined in the
`where` attribute
:::

## Dynamic Where Filter

You can pass the WHERE clause as a parameter to set dynamic conditions for filtering the response. In the below example, we are passing the WHERE clause as a parameter, where we use 'currency' as a filter.

```
query ($where: EVM_DEXTradeByToken_Filter) \{
  EVM(dataset: archive) \{
    DEXTradeByTokens(
      limit: \{count: 10\}
      where: $where
      orderBy: \{descending: Block_Date\}
    ) \{
      Block \{
        Date
      }
      sum(of: Trade_PriceInUSD)
    }
  }
}
<!-- Parameters -->
\{
  "where": \{
    "Trade": \{
      "Currency": \{
        "Symbol": \{
          "is": "PEPE"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> Note: This currently works only for chains on EAP.

### Passing Each Criterion as a Filter

Each condition can be passed as a parameter to allow for highly customizable queries.

For example, in the below query:

```
query(
  $network: evm_network
  $mempool: Boolean
	$currency_filter: EVM_DEXTradeByToken_Input_Trade_Currency_InputType
  $amount_usd_filter: EVM_Amount_With_Decimals
  $price_usd_filter: OLAP_Float
  $price_assymetry_filter: OLAP_Float
) \{
  EVM(network: $network mempool: $mempool) \{
    DEXTradeByTokens(
      orderBy: \{descending: Block_Number\}
      limit: \{count: 35\}

      where: \{

        Trade: \{
          Currency: $currency_filter
          AmountInUSD: $amount_usd_filter
          PriceInUSD: $price_usd_filter
          PriceAsymmetry: $price_assymetry_filter
        }

      }

    ) \{

      Block \{
        Time
      }

      Transaction \{
        Hash
      }

      Trade \{
        Buyer
        Seller
        Amount
        AmountInUSD
        Currency \{
          Symbol
          SmartContract
        }
        Price
        PriceInUSD
        PriceAsymmetry
        Side \{
          Currency \{
            SmartContract
            Symbol
          }
        }

      }

    }
  }
}
<!-- Parameter -->

\{
  "network": "matic",
  "mempool": false,
  "currency_filter": \{ "SmartContract": \{ "is": "0x53e0bca35ec356bd5dddfebbd1fc0fd03fabad39"\}\},
  "amount_usd_filter": \{"ge": "2000.0"\},
  "price_usd_filter": \{"ge": 13.59\},
  "price_assymetry_filter": \{"ge": 0.001\}
}
```

we have the following filters:

- **`$currency_filter`**: Filters trades by the currency involved using criteria based on the smart contract address.
- **`$amount_usd_filter`**: Filters trades by the amount in USD.
- **`$price_usd_filter`**: Filters trades by the price of the currency in USD.
- **`$price_assymetry_filter`**: Filters trades by the price asymmetry value.

## Filter Types

Depending on the data type of the element used in `where` filter, different operators can be applied.

### Numeric Filter Types

For numeric data, the following operators applicable:

- `eq` equals to
- `ne` not equals to
- `ge` greater or equal
- `gt` greater than
- `le` less or equal
- `lt` less than

:::tip
If you need to define the range of value, use `ge` and `le` together:

```
          GasUsed: \{
            ge: "26000000"
            le: "60000000"
          }
```

:::tip

:::note
Almost all numeric values in blockchain lies above the 32-bit boundary defined for numbers in GraphQL
and JSON. So the string values used instead to define any number with not limited precision.
:::

### String Filter Types

For string data, the following operators applicable:

- `is` equals to
- `not` not equals to
- `in` value exists in a list
- `notIn` value does not exist in a list
- `includes` contains a substring (case-sensitive)
- `includesCaseInsensitive` contains a substring (case-insensitive)
- `notIncludes` does not contain a substring (case-sensitive)
- `notIncludesCaseInsensitive` does not contain a substring (case-insensitive)
- `like` matches a pattern using wildcards (case-sensitive)
- `likeCaseInsensitive` matches a pattern using wildcards (case-insensitive)
- `notLike` does not match a pattern (case-sensitive)
- `notLikeCaseInsensitive` does not match a pattern (case-insensitive)
- `startsWith` starts with a specific value (case-sensitive)
- `startsWithCaseInsensitive` starts with a specific value (case-insensitive)
- `endsWith` ends with a specific value (case-sensitive)

When using `like` and `likeCaseInsensitive` filters, you can use **wildcards** for flexible pattern matching:

- `%` → Matches zero or more characters (e.g., `"%sol%"` matches `"mesolana"`, `"solid"`). Test the query [here](https://ide.bitquery.io/Currency-with-any-sol-inside)
- `_` → Matches exactly one character (e.g., `"s_l"` matches `"sol"`, `"sal"`). Test the query [here](https://ide.bitquery.io/Currency-with-trump-and-s)

- `notLike` does not match a pattern using wildcards (case-sensitive)
- `notLikeCaseInsensitive` does not match a pattern using wildcards (case-insensitive)

:::danger
`not` and `ne` filters do not prevent to query large amount of data, consider use them only with
some other filters
:::

### Date and Time Filter Types

For date and timestamp data, the following operators applicable:

- `is` date equals to
- `not` date not equals to
- `after` after certain date (not including it)
- `since` after including date
- `till` before including date
- `before` before not including date

### Array Filter Types

Array fields can be filtered using the following conditions:

- `length` condition on array length;
- `includes` if array include item defined by the condition;
- `excludes` if array exclude item defined by the condition;
- `startsWith` if array starts with the item defined by the condition;
- `endsWith` if array ends with the item defined by the condition;
- `notStartsWith` if array does not start with the item defined by the condition;
- `notEndsWith` if array does not end with the item defined by the condition;

:::note
Note that all conditions on items can be a list, they all applied to selecting the item in AND manner.
:::

Example of the condition is the following:

```
\{
  EVM \{
    Calls(
      where: \{
        Arguments: \{
					length: \{eq: 2\}
          includes: \{
            Index: \{eq: 0\}
            Name: \{is: "recipient"\}
          }
        }
      }
      limit: \{count: 10\}) \{
      Arguments \{
        Index
        Name
        Type
      }
      Call \{
        Signature \{
          Signature
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

Filter selects calls which have 2 arguments, and the first argument name is "recipient"

Condition can combine conditions on the items:

```
Arguments: \{
          includes: [
            \{
            Index: \{eq: 0\}
            Name: \{is: "recipient"\}
            Value: \{Address: \{is: "0xa7f6ebbd4cdb249a2b999b7543aeb1f80bda7969"\}\}
           }
           \{
            Name: \{is: "amount"\}
            Value: \{BigInteger: \{ge: "1000000000"\}\}
           }
          ]
        }
      }
```

It extends the previous example, selecting only calls that have all 4 conditions:

- the first argument named 'recipient'
- the first argument value of type address equal to '0xa7f6ebbd4cdb249a2b999b7543aeb1f80bda7969'
- any argument called "amount"
- argument named "amount" having value bigger than 1000000000

## Filtering: Where vs selectWhere

The `selectWhere` parameter functions similarly to the `HAVING` clause in SQL, allowing users to filter on aggregated data.

To demonstrate the use of `selectWhere`, consider the following query that retrieves blocks from the EVM dataset and filters based on a transaction count greater than 1,500,000.

```
query \{
  EVM(dataset: archive) \{
    Blocks \{
      Block \{
        Date
      }
      sum(of: Block_TxCount selectWhere: \{gt: "1500000"\})
    }
  }
}
```

**sum(of: Block_TxCount selectWhere: \{gt: "1500000"\})**: Applies the `sum` aggregate function to `Block_TxCount` and filters for sums greater than 1,500,000.

In this example, the query retrieves block data and applies a filter on the sum of transaction counts to include only those blocks where the transaction count exceeds 1,500,000.

This is different from the `where` clause, which is used to filter the blocks based on the transaction count:

```
query \{
  EVM(dataset: archive) \{
    Blocks(where: \{Block: \{TxCount: \{gt: 1500000\}\}}) \{
      Block \{
        Date
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- **Blocks(where: \{Block: \{TxCount: \{gt: 1500000\}\}\})**: Filters blocks directly where `TxCount` is greater than 1,500,000 before aggregation.

In this query, the `where` clause directly filters blocks with transaction counts greater than 1,500,000 before any aggregation occurs.
