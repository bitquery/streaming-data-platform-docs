# Early Access Program (EAP)

The Early Access Program (EAP) is a feature designed to provide users with access to streaming data across various blockchain networks, including Solana, Matic, and more, primarily for evaluation purposes. This initiative allows developers and researchers to explore and test real-time data from chains other than what we provide via V2 endpoint.

## How to Access EAP

Accessing the EAP is straightforward and involves a simple selection process within the Bitquery IDE interface. Navigate to [Bitquery IDE](https://ide.bitquery.io/?endpoint=https://streaming.bitquery.io/eap) to get started.

You can find examples on [Solana DEX Trades](/docs/examples/Solana/solana-dextrades.mdx) and Matic in our examples section.
