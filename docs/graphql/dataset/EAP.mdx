# Early Access Program (EAP)

The Early Access Program (EAP) provided users with access to streaming data across various blockchain networks, including Solana, Matic, and more. These chains have now been migrated to the v2 endpoint.

## How to Access v2 APIs

You can access v2 APIs through the Bitquery IDE interface. Navigate to [Bitquery IDE](https://ide.bitquery.io/) to get started.

You can find examples on [Solana DEX Trades](/docs/blockchain/Solana/solana-dextrades.mdx) and Matic in our examples section.

## How to Authorize Requests

APIs use OAuth token mechanism for authentication. Read more on how to generate a token [here](https://docs.bitquery.io/docs/authorisation/how-to-generate/)
