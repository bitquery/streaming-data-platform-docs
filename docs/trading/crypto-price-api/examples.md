# Quick Start Examples

## Real-Time Token Prices in USD on Solana

Stream live OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) price and volume data for all tokens on Solana, quoted directly in USD. Useful for dashboards, analytics, or bots that need stable fiat-based prices.

Here we have selected the filter `Price: {IsQuotedInUsd: true}`, this means that any price values such as OHLC or Average indicators will be in USD. If you want them denominated in quote currency, change the filter to `Price: {IsQuotedInUsd: false}`.

> Note: We include `Volume: { Usd: { gt: 5 } }` to further remove extreme outliers; the stream already pre-filters outliers—this is an additional check.

## Real-Time Token Prices in Quote Pair (USDC, USDT, etc.)

Stream live OHLC prices for Solana tokens denominated in their trading pair token (e.g., USDC, USDT, or another crypto), instead of direct USD. Great for analyzing token behavior relative to stablecoins or other assets.

Here we have selected the filter `Price: {IsQuotedInUsd: false}`, this means that any price values such as OHLC or Average indicators will be in quote currency. If you want them denominated in USD, change the filter to `Price: {IsQuotedInUsd: true}`.

## Real-Time Token Prices Against SOL/WSOL

Stream real-time OHLC and volume data for Solana tokens specifically paired against SOL or WSOL. Useful when building apps or bots that want token values expressed relative to Solana’s native currency.

Here we have selected the filter `Price: {IsQuotedInUsd: false}`, this means that any price values such as OHLC or Average indicators will be in quote currency. If you want them denominated in USD, change the filter to `Price: {IsQuotedInUsd: true}`.

## OHLC of a currency on multiple blockchains

This query retrieves the OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) prices of a currency(in this eg Bitcoin; it will include all sorts of currencies whose underlying asset is Bitcoin like cbBTC, WBTC, etc) across all supported blockchains, aggregated into a given time interval (e.g., 60 seconds in this example).

## OHLC Stream on a Chain

Mention the chain/network using the `Token: {Network}` filter.  
Available values: `Ethereum`, `Solana`, `Base`, `Optimism`, `Opbnb`, `Matic`, `Arbitrum`, `Binance Smart Chain`, `Tron`.

The available duration intervals are listed [here](https://docs.bitquery.io/docs/trading/price-index/introduction/#understanding-intervals).

In Tokens cube, only `IsQuotedInUsd:true` is supported so you will see OHLC and Price values in USD only.

Stream real-time OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) prices, trading volume, and moving averages for all tokens on a specific blockchain (e.g., Solana). Useful for market dashboards or monitoring live token activity on one chain.

## OHLC of a Token Pair Across Chains

This subscription fetches real-time OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) price data for a token pair across different blockchains.  
For **native tokens**, you only need to specify their ID (e.g., `bid:eth` for ETH).

Here we have selected the filter `Price: {IsQuotedInUsd: false}`, this means that any price values such as OHLC or Average indicators will be in terms of quote currency instead of USD. If you want them in USD, change the filter to `Price: {IsQuotedInUsd: true}`.
