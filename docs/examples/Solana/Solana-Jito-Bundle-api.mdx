# Jito Bundle API

In this section, we will show you how to access information about Jito Bundles using Bitquery APIs.

This Solana API is part of our Early Access Program (EAP).

You can use this program to try out the data and see how it works with your applications 
before you fully integrate it. You can learn more about this [here](https://docs.bitquery.io/docs/graphql/dataset/EAP/).

## Transfers to the Tip Payment Accounts

Jito foundation has  Tip Payment Program that allows users to transfer tips to a set of 
static public keys (compared to signing the transaction with the next N leaders) and ensure that 
the incentives are distributed to the correct block leader, while enabling bundles to execute in upto 8 parallel threads.

The subscription that provides you the transfer data of one of these addresses is [writen below](https://ide.bitquery.io/Transfers-of-Tip-Payment-Accounts-on-Solana_1#). 
To get the data of all addresses you can use the [this](https://ide.bitquery.io/Transfers-of-All-Tip-Payment-Accounts-on-Solana) query.

```graphql
subscription {
  Solana {
    Recieved: Transfers(
      where: {Transfer: {Receiver: {Address: {is: "HFqU5x63VTqvQss8hp11i4wVV8bD44PvwucfZ2bU7gRe"}}}}
    ) {
      Transfer {
        Currency {
          Name
          Symbol
          MintAddress
        }
        AmountInUSD
        Sender {
          Address
        }
      }
      Transaction {
        Signature
      }
      Block {
        Time
        Slot
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## List of methods for Jito Merkle Upload Authority
Jito Merkle Upload Autjority account is the block builder that uploads the root of Merkle
tree created by processing the MEV data in an offchain setting.

The [below query](https://ide.bitquery.io/All-Methods-for-Jito-Bundles-on-Solana_1) returns all the methods that are accessible to this account.

```graphql
{
  Solana {
    Instructions(
      where: {Transaction: {Signer: {is: "GZctHpWXmsZC1YHACTGGcHhYxjdRqQvTpYkb9LMvxDib"}}}
    ) {
      Instruction {
        Program {
          Address
          Method
          Name
        }
      }
      count
    }
  }
}

```
## More information on Transfer Method
From the above query, we'll get a list of methods that the account is signing. One of those 
method is "Transfer".

To get more info on the "Tranfer" method we can run the query given [below](https://ide.bitquery.io/Transfer-Function-Call-Event-Alert-for-Jito-Bundles-on-Solana_1).

```graphql
{
  Solana {
    Instructions(
      limit: {count:10},
      where: {Transaction: {Signer: {is: "GZctHpWXmsZC1YHACTGGcHhYxjdRqQvTpYkb9LMvxDib"}, Result: {Success: true}}, Instruction: {Program: {Method: {is: "Transfer"}}}}
    ) {
      Instruction {
        Program {
          Address
          Method
          Name
          Arguments {
            Name
            Type
            Value {
              ... on Solana_ABI_Integer_Value_Arg {
                integer
              }
              ... on Solana_ABI_String_Value_Arg {
                string
              }
              ... on Solana_ABI_Address_Value_Arg {
                address
              }
              ... on Solana_ABI_Json_Value_Arg {
                json
              }
              ... on Solana_ABI_Float_Value_Arg {
                float
              }
              ... on Solana_ABI_Boolean_Value_Arg {
                bool
              }
              ... on Solana_ABI_Bytes_Value_Arg {
                hex
              }
              ... on Solana_ABI_BigInt_Value_Arg {
                bigInteger
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
      Block {
        Slot,
        Time
      }
      Transaction {
        Signature
      }
    }
