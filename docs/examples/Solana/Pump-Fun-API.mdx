## Track New Token Creation on Pump Fun

Get notified about the newly created token and its information on Pump Fun DEX for getting early bird benefits.

### Get Pump Program Address and Method

To run our desired query we need two parameters, that are Program Address and Method Name. To get these parameters, we can run
the [following query](https://ide.bitquery.io/Get-Pump-Address-and-Method-Name?_gl=1*ygo5vg*_ga*MTQwMzE3MzI0My4xNzEyNjUzNzMw*_ga_ZWB80TDH9J*MTcxODg4MTYwOS4xMzMuMS4xNzE4ODgxNzg3LjAuMC4w).

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  Solana {
    Instructions(
      where: { Instruction: { Program: { Name: { is: "pump" } } } }
    ) {
      Instruction {
        Program {
          Method
          Address
        }
      }
      count
    }
  }
}
```

[Here](https://ide.bitquery.io/Track-new-token-launches-on-Pump-Fun-in-realtime) is the subscription to get the notification of new token creation event on Pump Fun.

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  Solana {
    Instructions(
      where: { Instruction: { Program: { Name: { is: "pump" } } } }
    ) {
      Instruction {
        Program {
          Method
          Address
        }
      }
      count
    }
  }
}
```

## Get OHLC Data of a Token on Pump Fun

The below query gets OHLC data of the specified Token `66VR6bjEV5DPSDhYSQyPAxNsY3dgmH6Lwgi5cyf2pump` for 1 minute time interval for last 10 minutes on Pump Fun DEX.
You can run the query [here](https://ide.bitquery.io/OHLC-for-a-token-on-Pump-Fun_3)

Note - You can only use this API using `query` keyword, using this API as `subscription` will give wrong results because aggregation and interval don't work correctly together in `subscription`.

```graphql
query {
  Solana {
    DEXTradeByTokens(
      limit: { count: 10 }
      orderBy: { descendingByField: "Block_Timefield" }
      where: {
        Trade: {
          Currency: {
            MintAddress: { is: "66VR6bjEV5DPSDhYSQyPAxNsY3dgmH6Lwgi5cyf2pump" }
          }
          Dex: {
            ProgramAddress: {
              is: "6EF8rrecthR5Dkzon8Nwu78hRvfCKubJ14M5uBEwF6P"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ) {
      Block {
        Timefield: Time(interval: { in: minutes, count: 1 })
      }
      volume: sum(of: Trade_Amount)
      Trade {
        high: Price(maximum: Trade_Price)
        low: Price(minimum: Trade_Price)
        open: Price(minimum: Block_Slot)
