# Solana Instructions API

This Solana API is part of our Early Access Program (EAP), which is intended for evaluation purposes.

This program allows you to test the data and its integration into your applications before full-scale implementation. Read more [here](https://docs.bitquery.io/docs/graphql/dataset/EAP/)

## Latest Solana Instructions

The subscription below fetches the latest instructions executed on the Solana blockchain including details like indices of preceding instructions signer, signature, balance updates, and program details

You can run the query [here](https://ide.bitquery.io/Latest-Solana-Instructions)

```
subscription {
  Solana(network: solana) {
    Instructions(limit: {count: 10}, orderBy: {descending: Block_Time}) {
      Transaction {
        Signer
        Signature
        Result {
          Success
          ErrorMessage
        }
        Index
      }
      Instruction {
        Logs
        BalanceUpdatesCount
        AncestorIndexes
        TokenBalanceUpdatesCount
        Program {
          Name
          Method
        }
      }
      Block {
        Time
        Hash
      }
    }
  }
}

```

## Latest Created Tokens on Solana

The query below fetches the latest created tokens on the Solana blockchain including details like newly created token address which is the 1st entry in the Accounts array. We are querying Solana Token Program here with address `TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA` and filtering for latest created tokens using `Method: {in: ["initializeMint", "initializeMint2", "initializeMint3"]}`.

You can run the query [here](https://ide.bitquery.io/Get-newly-created-tokens-on-Solana_1)

```
subscription {
  Solana {
    Instructions(
      where: {Instruction: {Program: {Address: {is: "TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA"}, Method: {in: ["initializeMint", "initializeMint2"]}}}, Transaction: {Result: {Success: true}}}
    ) {
      Instruction {
        Accounts {
          Address
          IsWritable
          Token {
            Mint
            Owner
            ProgramId
          }
        }
        Program {
          AccountNames
          Address
        }
      }
      Transaction {
        Signature
        Signer
      }
    }
  }
}



```

## Number of Latest Created Tokens on Solana

The query below fetches the count of the latest created tokens on the Solana blockchain which were created using `initializeMint` method.

You can run the query [here](https://ide.bitquery.io/Count---Tokens-created-on-Solana)

```
query MyQuery {
  Solana(dataset: realtime, network: solana) {
    Instructions(
      where: {Instruction: {Program: {Address: {is: "TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA"}, Method: {is: "initializeMint"}}}}
      limit: {count: 10}
    ) {
      count
      Block {
        latest: Time(maximum: Block_Time)
        oldest: Time(minimum: Block_Time)
      }
    }
  }
}


```

## Get Authorities of tokens on Solana

The query below fetches all the authorities such as mint authority, freeze authority and update authority and also the token address on the Solana blockchain in realtime. The 1st entry in the Accounts array is the mint and the freeze authority, 2nd entry in the Accounts array is the token address, and 3rd entry in the Accounts array is the update authority.

You can run the query [here](https://ide.bitquery.io/get-authorities-of-tokens-on-solana_2)

```
subscription{
  Solana {
    Instructions(
      where: {Instruction: {Program: {Address: {is: "metaqbxxUerdq28cj1RbAWkYQm3ybzjb6a8bt518x1s"}, Method: {is: "CreateMasterEditionV3"}}}}
    ) {
      Instruction {
        Accounts {
          Address
        }
        Program {
          Method
          AccountNames
          Address
          Name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

## Track Real-time Token Burn on Solana

Receive real-time updates on token burn events on the Solana blockchain. The below query applies a filter to only include instructions where:
Program Method includes `burn`, indicating that the instruction is related to token burning.

```

subscription {
  Solana {
    Instructions(
      where: {Instruction: {Program: {Method: {includes: "burn"}}}, Transaction: {Result: {Success: true}}}
    ) {
      Instruction {
        Accounts {
          Address
          IsWritable
          Token {
            Mint
            Owner
            ProgramId
          }
        }
        Program {
          AccountNames
          Address
          Name

      Transaction {
        Signature
        Signer
      }
    }
  }
}
